The awesome folks at DCG have open sourced their great suite of plugins for Lightwave.  Others have taken on the quest to update the shaders to the new model for LW 2018.   I'm much more involved in projects that need landscape and geodata and am taking a stab at getting  Ground Control working under 2018.   

This fork will initially be for the modifications needed to get GC working as designed and on par with 2015 functionality.  Once that's done, improvments and expansion are planned.
