The awesome folks at DCG have open sourced their great suite of plugins for Lightwave.  Others have taken on the quest to update the shaders to the new model for LW 2018.   I'm much more involved in projects that need landscape and geodata and am taking a stab at getting  Ground Control working under 2018.   

Modifications needed to get GroundControl working with LW 2018, 2018 and 2019 are in place.  It appears to be stable and consistent across versions.  I do not have any versions prior to 2015 to test against.  If you do, and encounter issues, open an Issue with as much detail as you can and I'll see what can be done to track it down.   

I am looking for sample files for each of the data types GC supports to add to my test suite.  If there's something you use regularly, please let me know what it is and where I can get it so I can make sure it continues to be supported and stable going forward.  

The current version of the development / testing plugin you can play with is going to be at: 

https://github.com/scottbragg/GroundControl/tree/development/LightwavePlugins/GroundControl/plugins

The development branch is always going to the be most recent build and may or may not be stable.  Use at your own risk.
